      <h1 id="title">My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
      <p>
        I started my journey in web development on September 15, 2024,by joining
        Dugisye’s Full Stack Mentorship Program. From day one,I was excited to
        dive into coding and begin building the skills necessary to become a
        professional full-stack developer

      <h2>Month 1 – HTML Foundations</h2>
      <p>
        In the first month, I focused fully on HTML, completing the course and
        taking on small challenges to practice what I learned. These exercises
        helped me understand the structure of web pages and build confidence in
        creating functional websites.
      </p>
      <h2>Months 2–4 – CSS, Git, and Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        Over the next three months, I completed the CSS course, learning how to
        style web pages and make them visually appealing. I also started
        learning GitHub and collaboration techniques. During this time, I worked
        with Faiza and Kafi, two fellow students, to recreate a website template
        we found online using only HTML and CSS. This project taught me valuable
        teamwork skills and how to collaborate effectively on coding projects.
      </p>
      <h2>Early 2025 – JavaScript Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2025, I started learning JavaScript. It was my first
        programming language, and I faced many challenges, which is normal for
        beginners. Unfortunately, my subscription to the program ended during
        this period, and I had to pause my learning before fully mastering
        JavaScript.
      </p>
      <h2>Searching for Quality Bootcamps</h2>
      <p>
        Determined to continue my journey, I joined FreeCodeCamp to keep
        practicing and improving my skills. At the same time, I researched
        affordable bootcamps that provide the same quality of mentorship as
        Dugisye. My friend Usame recommended an amazing bootcamp where you can
        code live while the teacher explains, seeing real-time changes and
        completing challenges in one screen.
      </p>
      <h2>Restarting Full Stack Learning from Scratch</h2>
      <p>
        I decided to start again from scratch, learning HTML, CSS, GitHub,
        JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and databases. This program
        involves 108 hours of focused learning, combining theory, practical
        exercises, and real-world projects. Now, I am near the end of this
        journey, proud of the progress I’ve made, and excited about the
        opportunities that lie ahead as a full-stack developer.
      </p>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        This journey has been full of challenges, learning, and growth. From
        facing my first programming struggles in JavaScript to collaborating on
        projects and mastering new technologies, every step has brought me
        closer to my goal. I am motivated to continue building projects,
        expanding my skills, and pursuing a career in web development.
